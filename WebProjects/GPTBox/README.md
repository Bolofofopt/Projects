# GPTBOX Overview
This project, done in the context of the final course project, consisted of developing a WebApp, that has the objective of helping clients that need to store/transport objects reach companies in the storage and transport regime.

The clients that want to use our services need to be registered in our database and they can do so through one of the pages on the website, to access the form to know the companies they need to log in.
The website is hosted in a WebServer and on a portable XAMPP configured by us.

To do this I needed to develop a WebApp down to the configuration of the WebServer, Relational Databases & FTP Accounts to the development of Frontend & Backend.
This project was done on 3 Servers so I needed to migrate the Databases to each server which provided a very good skill of migrating servers.

## Configuration of the WebServer
To configure the WebServer I used cPanel, a tool used when the SO is Linux, and with this tool I've created Databases, MySQL Users & FTP Accounts.

## Database

#### phpMyAdmin used to overview and configure tables

## WordPress
For the development of the WebApp itself I used WordPress because the focus wasn't to build a strong Frontend with HTML, CSS & JavaScript but to build a strong and secure Backend so the users can use the forms in a safe environment.

## HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Entrylevel)
For the forms I used HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
HTMl for the form itself
CSS for the interactive buttons
JavaScript for the pop-up confirmation when submitting a form

## PHP
The backend of this WebApp is very secure and on a safe environment, the passwords are encripted to protect the data of the users and on the Database all that relations that are made are by IDs.
Given that this WebApp has some pages it has a total of 4 PHP files to login, change passwords, the form itself and to signup.

## CyberSecurity Agains SQL Injections
The Database is protected agains SQL injections by using a user with less permissions so it can't delete or change data that he isn't suposed to.

# TODO
This project was presented and stated that was finished. But there are improvements that I want to do, like:
-        Improve the sign in method
-        Host the WebApp in a personal server, with SSL certificates
-        Improve the form, to be automatically updated when the user chooses a option
